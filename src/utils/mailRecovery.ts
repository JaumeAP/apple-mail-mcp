/**
 * Mail.app recovery: open Mail when it is closed, restart it when it is wedged.
 *
 * Every AppleScript call goes through one synchronous osascript, so a Mail.app
 * that has stopped answering Apple Events (days of uptime, a stuck sync) makes
 * every tool fail with `AppleEvent timed out (-1712)` until somebody restarts
 * it by hand. `ensureMailReady` runs before an AppleScript call and fixes the
 * two states a restart cures:
 *
 *   - Mail is not running: open it (`open -g -a Mail`) and wait until it answers.
 *   - Mail is running but a cheap probe times out: quit it, force-kill it if it
 *     will not quit, open it again and wait until it answers.
 *
 * It never retries a failed call, so a send that timed out is never sent twice;
 * the next call simply finds a healthy Mail. A restart happens at most once per
 * RESTART_COOLDOWN_MS, and only the current user's own Mail process is touched.
 * Permission refusals (-1743) are left alone: a restart does not cure them.
 *
 * Set APPLE_MAIL_MCP_AUTO_RECOVER=0 to turn the automatic part off; the
 * `restart-mail` tool keeps working.
 *
 * @module utils/mailRecovery
